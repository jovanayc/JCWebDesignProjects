# Crown & Canvas Hair & Beauty – Landing Page

Welcome to the **Crown & Canvas Hair & Beauty** landing page project — a stylish, modern single-page design built to showcase the visual branding and online presence of a luxury beauty salon. Originally developed for a school assignment, this project has been refined as part of my **web design & development portfolio** to demonstrate my capabilities in visual design, responsive layout, and brand storytelling through digital experiences.

## 💡 Why This Project?

This project allowed me to combine my design instincts with real-world branding needs. By building for a real salon, which can be found at: [https://www.styleseat.com/m/v/crownandcanvas?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAads_v73JhgSiK8IzIn5nPpMnlNCO9qCt-oZzC3b8DbC9nWJppHa8-97_5gYdA_aem_fSfKHIrm_6W12cXI3XuW_w](url)

* Created website from scratch
* Researched competitor brands and similar websites
* Tone-setting through color and imagery
* Strategic content structuring
* Designing for conversion (i.e., clear booking paths)

It now serves as a strong example of my front-end design sensibility and ability to translate brand identity into digital form.

## 🚀 Next Steps

* Build fully coded additional pages
* Integrate with CMS for dynamic updates (optional future enhancement)
